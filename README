== What is phpMyS3backup? ==
phpMyS3backup is a PHP based tool that will backup a MySQL server to Amazon's 
S3 service ( http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ ).  The tool requires php5-cli
and mysqldump, it also uses the AWS SDK for PHP (
https://github.com/amazonwebservices/aws-sdk-for-php ) which is included.

== How to use? ==
* Grab a copy of the latest code: http://goo.gl/t7GLh
* Rename sample.config.inc.php to config.inc.php
* Fill in the blanks for config.inc.php
* Execute `php phpMyS3backup.php` and wait
* When you get dropped back to the command line, check your S3
* Done!

== How it works? ==
Here's the short version of what this tool does:
* Get's a list of all your databases (except `information_schema`)
* mysqldump each database to it's own file
* gzip's each dump file
* Creates a unique S3 bucket based on the server name & AWS key
* Upload all files (under a unique date/time folder name) to S3
** All files are stored with:
*** Reduced Redundancy Storage
*** AES256 Encryption
*** "Private" permissions (no sharing)
* Delete the local backups
